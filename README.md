# CodeAlpha_HANGMAN-GAME

📌 Description:
This is a console-based Hangman game written in Python using an intermediate-level structure. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and challenges the user to guess it one letter at a time.

The player has a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses, after which the game ends. It includes clear input validation, live feedback, and clean user experience in the terminal.

⚙️ Key Features:
Random word selection from a custom word bank

Input validation to accept only single, unguessed alphabet letters

Tracks and displays:

Correctly guessed letters in position

Remaining wrong attempts

All letters guessed so far

Win or lose condition handling with appropriate messages

Modular code using functions for readability and reuse

🧠 Concepts Used:
random.choice() for word selection

sets and lists for tracking guessed letters and display

functions for separating game logic cleanly

while loop and if-else conditions for game flow control

String manipulation and terminal output formatting

🎯 Learning Outcome:
Through this project, I practiced:

Writing clean, reusable Python functions

Validating and handling user input effectively

Implementing game logic and loop conditions

Making terminal-based games with real-time feedback
